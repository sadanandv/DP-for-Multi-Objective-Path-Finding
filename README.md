# DP-for-Multi-Objective-Path-Finding
This project implements a modular pipeline for solving multi-objective pathfinding problems on a 2D grid using **dynamic programming (DP)** principles. Inspired by the paper "Time Dependency in Multiple Objective Dynamic Programming" by Michael M. Kostreva and Malgorzata M. Wiecek
